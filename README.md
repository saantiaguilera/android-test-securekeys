### Sample app for testing the library SecureKeys

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/saantiaguilera/android-test-securekeys/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/saantiaguilera/android-test-securekeys/tree/master)

This application is not for design/coding purposes, as everything is left by the default android studio project wizard.

This project is simply for trying out and testing that the SecureKeys library works as intended

For testing the generated APKs, check the artifacts for the desired circleci branch, and download the generated APKs. They should work as intended :)
